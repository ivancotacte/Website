                    <p>Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz", in Japan in the mid 1990's. It was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto was born in 1965, and was raised in Yonago-shi, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. He earned a degree in information science at the University of Tsukuba. He created the Ruby programming language, and is a distinguished researcher at Network Applied Communication Laboratory Ltd. and the chairman of Ruby Association.</p>

                    <p>Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Raku, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language.</p>

                    <p>PHP was conceived sometime in the fall of 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. Early non-released versions were used on his home page to keep track of who was looking at his online resume. The first version used by others was available sometime in early 1995 and was known as the Personal Home Page Tools.</p>         
                    <br>
                    <p>Rasmus Lerdorf born 22 November 1968 is a Danish-Canadian programmer. He co-authored and inspired the PHP scripting language, authoring the first two versions of the language and participating in the development of later versions led by a group of developers including Jim Winstead, Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, and Zeev Suraski. He continues to contribute to the project.</p>

                    <p>Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., where James Gosling led a team of researchers in an effort to create a new language that would allow consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other. Work on the language began in 1991, and before long the team's focus changed to a new niche, the World Wide Web.</p>         
                    <br>
                    <p>James Arthur Gosling was born in 1956 near Calgary, Alberta. He received his BS in computer science from the University of Calgary in 1977.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.</p>         
                    <br>
                    <p>Brendan Eich born July 4, 1961 is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
